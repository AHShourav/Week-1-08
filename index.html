<p>A weekend hobby for Joanna Goddard turned into a full-time job. 
    She started A Cup of Jo in 2007 and became a superstar lifestyle blogger.
    <br> In fact, the site is barely a personal blog anymore, as Jo now has a team of professional writers who share her interests, such as style, design, food, and motherhood.
    <br>End
